# simple-chat-app
A chat application with socket io and React that allows people 
to invite friends by their username and start conversations.

It features a basic implementation of notifications were it checks
to see if a user is currently in a room, away or offline and notifies
them accordingly.

Usernames currently are randomly generated in a similar way to Reddit,
but with a poorer vocabulary as I only did some quick web scraping to grab
some adjectives and nouns from a couple of websites. It also means that
I don't have to moderate usernames.
